Based on the data depicted in the DVD Rental Business database, I chose to analyze which customers had a tendency to rent the same film more than once. Business owners and stakeholders may be interested in capitalizing on a subgroup of customers who enjoy a particular film to the extent of renting it on more than one occasion. Businesses may opt to provide incentives, such as discounts for future rentals of the same film, any prequels/sequels to that film or films with similar criteria, such as genre and plotlines.
